Slides for a short [talk at the Brisbane Functional Programming Group] [BFPG],
June 2012.

These are probably only useful if you need to jog your memory about something I
said at the talk.  If you really want to learn Template Haskell and
QuasiQuotes, you should probably just head straight to the [Template Haskell
wiki page][TH], and start following links from there.

Learning Template Haskell does require some detective work. Those resources
which are up-to-date, namely the [relevant section of the GHC user manual]
[manual] and the [Template Haskell library API documentation] [API], are not
intended as tutorials. And many of the resources which are useful for learning
Template Haskell are either not altogether comprehensive, or somewhat out of
date. But you're clever, so I'm sure you'll work it out!
